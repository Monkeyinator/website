That is, you pass it an async\\ncallback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the\\ngiven callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.\\n\\n#### Some subclasses:\\n\\nHere\'s some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.\\nSend a pull request to list yours!\\n\\n * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints\\n * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints\\n * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\\n * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\\n\\n\\nInstallation\\n------------\\n\\nInstall with `npm`:\\n\\n``` bash\\n$ npm install agent-base\\n```\\n\\n\\nExample\\n-------\\n\\nHere\'s a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server\\nfor every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):\\n\\n```js\\nvar net = require(\'net\');\\nvar tls = require(\'tls\');\\nvar url = require(\'url\');\\nvar http = require(\'http\');\\nvar agent = require(\'agent-base\');\\n\\nvar endpoint = \'http://nodejs.org/api/\';\\nvar parsed = url.parse(endpoint);\\n\\n// This is the important part!\\nparsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {\\n  var socket;\\n  // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module\\n  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {\\n    socket = tls.connect(opts);\\n  } else {\\n    socket = net.connect(opts);\\n  }\\n  return socket;\\n});\\n\\n// Everything else works just like normal...\\nhttp.get(parsed, function (res) {\\n  console.log(\'\\"response\\" event!\', res.headers);\\n  res.pipe(process.stdout);\\n});\\n```\\n\\nReturning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:\\n\\n```js\\nagent(async function (req, opts) {\\n  await sleep(1000);\\n  // etc\u2026\\n});\\n```\\n\\nReturn another `http.Agent` instance to \\"pass through\\" the responsibility\\nfor that HTTP request to that agent:\\n\\n```js\\nagent(function (req, opts) {\\n  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;\\n});\\n```\\n\\n\\nAPI\\n---\\n\\n## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) \u2192 [http.Agent][]\\n\\nCreates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`\\nfor every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function\\nis responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be\\nused as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.\\n\\nThe `options` object accepts the following properties:\\n\\n  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).\\n\\nThe callback function should have the following signature:\\n\\n### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) \u2192 undefined\\n\\nThe ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and\\nand the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed\\nto the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted\\nto be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however\\nelse you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to\\nthe callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will\\ncontinue to proceed.\\n\\nIf the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the\\n`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.\\n\\n\\nLicense\\n-------\\n\\n(The MIT License)\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\\n\'Software\'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\\nthe following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \'AS IS\', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\\n\\n[http-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-http-proxy-agent\\n[https-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent\\n[pac-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-pac-proxy-agent\\n[socks-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent\\n[http.Agent]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent","licenseModified":"no","path":"/Users//Development/Portfolio/node_modules/agent-base"},"ajv-formats@2.1.1":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-formats","publisher":"Evgeny Poberezkin","name":"ajv-formats","version":"2.1.1","description":"Format validation for Ajv v7+","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2020 Evgeny Poberezkin","licenseFile":"/Users//Development/Portfolio/node_modules/ajv-formats/LICENSE","licenseText":"MIT License\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2020 Evgeny Poberezkin\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \\"Software\\"), to deal\\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\"AS IS\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\\n==========================\\n\\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python\'s\\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\\n\\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\\nsoftware.\\n\\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\\nZope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\\nhttps://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\\ncreated specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\\nZope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\\n\\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for\\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\\nthe various releases.\\n\\n    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\\n                    from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don\'t.\\n\\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\\n    CNRI, however, Stallman\'s lawyer has told CNRI\'s lawyer that 1.6.1\\n    is \\"not incompatible\\" with the GPL.\\n\\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido\'s\\ndirection to make these releases possible.\\n\\n\\nB.

Limitations on Grant Scope\\n\\n     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under\\n     this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\\n     distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\\n     Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\\n     Contributor:\\n\\n     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\\n\\n     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party\'s\\n        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\\n        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\\n        Version); or\\n\\n     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\\n        its Contributions.\\n\\n     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\\n     or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\\n     the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\\n\\n2.4.

Fair Use\\n\\n     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under\\n     applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other\\n     equivalents.\\n\\n2.7.

Distribution of Source Form\\n\\n     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\\n     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\\n     the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\\n     Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\\n     License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\\n     attempt to alter or restrict the recipients\' rights in the Source Code\\n     Form.\\n\\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\\n\\n     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\\n\\n     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,\\n        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\\n        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\\n        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\\n        of distribution to the recipient; and\\n\\n     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\\n        License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\\n        license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the\\n        recipients\' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\\n\\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\\n\\n     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\\n     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\\n     the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\\n     Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\\n     Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\\n     License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\\n     under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\\n     the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\\n     Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\\n     License(s).\\n\\n3.4. Notices\\n\\n     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\\n     (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or\\n     limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the\\n     Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the\\n     extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\\n\\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\\n\\n     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\\n     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\\n     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\\n     behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\\n     such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\\n     You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\\n     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\\n     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\\n     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\\n     jurisdiction.\\n\\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\\n\\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License\\n   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,\\n   judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of\\n   this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the\\n   limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a\\n   text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under\\n   this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,\\n   such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary\\n   skill to be able to understand it.\\n\\n5. Termination\\n\\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You\\n     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,\\n     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor\\n     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor\\n     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing\\n     basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by\\n     some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into\\n     compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are\\n     reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the\\n     non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have\\n     received notice of non-compliance with this License from such\\n     Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt\\n     of the notice.\\n\\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\\n     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\\n     counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\\n     directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\\n     You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\\n     2.1 of this License shall terminate.\\n\\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\\n     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\\n     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to\\n     termination shall survive termination.\\n\\n6. Disclaimer of Warranty\\n\\n   Covered Software is provided under this License on an \\"as is\\" basis,\\n   without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,\\n   including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free\\n   of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.\\n   The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software\\n   is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,\\n   You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,\\n   repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential\\n   part of this License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under\\n   this License except under this disclaimer.\\n\\n7. Limitation of Liability\\n\\n   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including\\n   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who\\n   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any\\n   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\\n   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\\n   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\\n   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been\\n   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability\\n   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from\\n   such party\'s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such\\n   limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of\\n   incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may\\n   not apply to You.\\n\\n8. Litigation\\n\\n   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts\\n   of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of\\n   business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\\n   jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing\\n   in this Section shall prevent a party\'s ability to bring cross-claims or\\n   counter-claims.\\n\\n9. Miscellaneous\\n\\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\\n   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\\n   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\\n   necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that\\n   the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not\\n   be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\\n\\n\\n10. Versions of the License\\n\\n10.1. New Versions\\n\\n      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\\n      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\\n      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\\n      distinguishing version number.\\n\\n10.2. Effect of New Versions\\n\\n      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version\\n      of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,\\n      or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\\n      steward.\\n\\n10.3. Modified Versions\\n\\n      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\\n      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a\\n      modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\\n      any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\\n      such modified license differs from this License).\\n\\n10.4.

This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\\n     terminate automatically.\\n\\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\\n\\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\\n          violation; or\\n\\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\\n\\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\\n     of this Public License.\\n\\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\\n     will not terminate this Public License.\\n\\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\\n     License.\\n\\n\\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\\n\\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\\n\\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\\n\\n\\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\\n\\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\\n\\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\\n     conditions.\\n\\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\\n     Licensor.\\n\\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\\n\\n\\n=======================================================================\\n\\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\\nlicenses.

Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\\n   to, the following:\\n   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\\n      and translate a Work;\\n   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\\n   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person\u2019s image or likeness\\n      depicted in a Work;\\n   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\\n      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\\n   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\\n      a Work;\\n   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\\n      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\\n      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\\n      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\\n   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\\n      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\\n      thereof.\\n\\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\\n   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\\n   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer\u2019s Copyright\\n   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\\n   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\\n   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\\n   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \u201cWaiver\u201d). Affirmer\\n   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and\\n   to the detriment of Affirmer\u2019s heirs and successors, fully intending that\\n   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\\n   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\\n   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer\u2019s express\\n   Statement of Purpose.\\n\\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\\n   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\\n   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\\n   Affirmer\u2019s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the\\n   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\\n   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\\n   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer\u2019s Copyright and\\n   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\\n   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \u201cLicense\u201d). The License\\n   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\\n   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\\n   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\\n   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\\n   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\\n   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\\n   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\\n   in either case contrary to Affirmer\u2019s express Statement of Purpose.\\n\\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\\n   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\\n      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\\n   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\\n      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or\\n      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,\\n      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or\\n      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or\\n      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest\\n      extent permissible under applicable law.\\n   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\\n      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\\n      limitation any person\u2019s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\\n      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\\n      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\\n   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\\n      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this\\n      CC0 or use of the Work.\\n\\nFor more information, please see\\nhttp://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/.","licenseModified":"no","path":"/Users//Development/Portfolio/node_modules/css-prefers-color-scheme"},"css-select-base-adapter@0.1.1":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/nrkn/css-select-base-adapter","publisher":"Nik Coughlin","email":"nrkn.com@gmail.com","name":"css-select-base-adapter","version":"0.1.1","description":"Provides some base functions needed by a css-select adapter so that you don\'t have to implement the whole thing.","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2018 Nik Coughlin","licenseFile":"/Users//Development/Portfolio/node_modules/css-select-base-adapter/LICENSE","licenseText":"MIT License\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2018 Nik Coughlin\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \\"Software\\"), to deal\\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\"AS IS\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This is so that you may use any ES6 standard Promise compliant library - or, of course, native ES6 Promises.\\n\\nIf you\'re running the code on a browser or node version that doesn\'t include native promises you will need to include a polyfill.  The following polyfills are tested as part of this module\'s test suite:-\\n- [Jake Archibald](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake)\'s [ES6 Promise library](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise) (which is actually adapted from [Stefan Penner](https://twitter.com/stefanpenner)\'s [RSVP.js](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js)). -  `require(\'es6-promise\').polyfill();`\\n- [Getify](https://twitter.com/getify)\'s [Native Promise Only library](https://github.com/getify/native-promise-only) - `require(\'native-promise-only\');`\\n- [ES6 Shim](https://github.com/es-shims/es6-shim) - `require(\'es6-shim\');`\\n- [Calvin Metcalf](https://twitter.com/CWMma)\'s [Lie](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/lie) - `global.Promise = global.Promise || require(\'lie\');`\\n\\nNote: as of v1.2.0 you can use **denodeify** in the front end.  Pull it in via CommonJS, AMD or simply add to your webpage and it\'ll be available on `window.denodeify`. \\n\\n## Installation\\n\\n```\\nnpm install denodeify --save\\n```\\n\\nOr:-\\n\\n```\\nbower install denodeify --save\\n```\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\nSimple example with [`readFile`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/read-file):-\\n\\n```js\\nrequire(\'es6-promise\').polyfill();\\n\\nvar denodeify = require(\'denodeify\');\\nvar readFile = denodeify(require(\'fs\').readFile);\\n\\nreadFile(\'my-file.txt\', { encoding: \'UTF-8\' })\\n  .then(function(text) {\\n    console.log(\\"My file\'s contents is: \\" + text);\\n  });\\n```\\n\\n(Note: you will need to also install [es6-promise](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise) with `npm install es6-promise` for this code sample to work within node versions that don\'t have `Promise` natively available)\\n\\nMore complex example with `exec`:-\\n\\n## Advanced usage\\n\\nYou can also pass in a function as a second argument of `denodeify` that allows you to manipulate the data returned by the wrapped function before it gets passed to the Promise\'s `reject` or `resolve` functions, for example:-\\n\\n```js\\nrequire(\'es6-promise\').polyfill();\\n\\nvar denodeify = require(\'denodeify\');\\nvar exec = denodeify(require(\'child_process\').exec, function(err, stdout, stderr) {\\n\\n  // Throw away stderr data\\n  return [err, stdout];\\n});\\n\\nexec(\'hostname\')\\n  .then(function(host) {\\n    console.log(\\"My hostname is: \\" + host.replace(\'\\\\n\', \'\'));\\n  });\\n```\\n\\nOr,\\n\\n```js\\nrequire(\'es6-promise\').polyfill();\\n\\nvar denodeify = require(\'denodeify\');\\nvar exec = denodeify(require(\'child_process\').exec, function(err, stdout, stderr) {\\n  return [err, [stdout, stderr]];\\n});\\n\\nexec(\'my-command\')\\n  .then(function(results) {\\n    console.log(\\"stdout is: \\" + results[0]);\\n    console.log(\\"stderr is: \\" + results[1]);\\n  });\\n```\\n\\nUseful for functions that return multiple arguments, for example [`child_process#exec`](http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback).\\n\\n## Credits and collaboration ##\\n\\nThe lead developer of **denodeify** is [Matt Andrews](http://twitter.com/andrewsmatt) at FT Labs with much help and support from [Kornel Lesi\u0144ski](https://twitter.com/pornelski).

AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).\\n\\n```javascript\\nesrecurse.visit(\\n    ast,\\n    {\\n        Literal: function (node) {\\n            // do something...\\n        }\\n    },\\n    {\\n        fallback: \'iteration\'\\n    }\\n);\\n```\\n\\nIf the `fallback` option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes.\\nPlease note circular references cause the stack overflow.

When given a list\\nof glob patterns for possible files to be included in the file\\nlist, instead of searching the file structures to find the files,\\na FileList holds the pattern for latter use.\\n\\nThis allows you to define a FileList to match any number of\\nfiles, but only search out the actual files when then FileList\\nitself is actually used. The key is that the first time an\\nelement of the FileList/Array is requested, the pending patterns\\nare resolved into a real list of file names.\\n\\n### Usage\\n\\nAdd files to the list with the `include` method. You can add glob\\npatterns, individual files, or RegExp objects. When the Array\\nmethods are invoked on the FileList, these items are resolved to\\nan actual list of files.\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar fl = new FileList();\\nfl.include(\'test/*.js\');\\nfl.exclude(\'test/helpers.js\');\\n```\\n\\nUse the `exclude` method to override inclusions. You can use this\\nwhen your inclusions are too broad.\\n\\n### Array methods\\n\\nFileList has lazy-evaluated versions of most of the array\\nmethods, including the following:\\n\\n* join\\n* pop\\n* push\\n* concat\\n* reverse\\n* shift\\n* unshift\\n* slice\\n* splice\\n* sort\\n* filter\\n* forEach\\n* some\\n* every\\n* map\\n* indexOf\\n* lastIndexOf\\n* reduce\\n* reduceRight\\n\\nWhen you call one of these methods, the items in the FileList\\nwill be resolved to the full list of files, and the method will\\nbe invoked on that result.\\n\\n### Special `length` method\\n\\n`length`: FileList includes a length *method* (instead of a\\nproperty) which returns the number of actual files in the list\\nonce it\'s been resolved.\\n\\n### FileList-specific methods\\n\\n`include`: Add a filename/glob/regex to the list\\n\\n`exclude`: Override inclusions by excluding a filename/glob/regex\\n\\n`resolve`: Resolve the items in the FileList to the full list of\\nfiles. This method is invoked automatically when one of the array\\nmethods is called.\\n\\n`toArray`: Immediately resolves the list of items, and returns an\\nactual array of filepaths.\\n\\n`clearInclusions`: Clears any pending items -- must be used\\nbefore resolving the list.\\n\\n`clearExclusions`: Clears the list of exclusions rules.","licenseModified":"no","path":"/Users//Development/Portfolio/node_modules/filelist"},"filesize@8.0.7":{"licenses":"BSD-3-Clause","repository":"https://github.com/avoidwork/filesize.js","publisher":"Jason Mulligan","email":"jason.mulligan@avoidwork.com","name":"filesize","version":"8.0.7","description":"JavaScript library to generate a human readable String describing the file size","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2022, Jason Mulligan.

Produces ESTree AST","copyright":"","licenseFile":"/Users//Development/Portfolio/node_modules/flow-parser/README.md","licenseText":"# The flow-parser package\\n\\nThis package contains the Flow parser in its compiled-to-JavaScript form.\\n\\n# What is Flow\\n\\nSee [flow.org](https://flow.org/). The code for the Flow parser [lives on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/flow/tree/master/src/parser).\\n\\n# What is the Flow Parser\\n\\nThe Flow Parser is a JavaScript parser written in OCaml. It produces an AST that conforms to the [ESTree spec](https://github.com/estree/estree) and that mostly matches what [esprima](http://esprima.org/) produces. The Flow Parser can be compiled to native code or can be compiled to JavaScript using [js_of_ocaml](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/). This npm package contains the Flow parser compiled to JavaScript.\\n\\n# Usage\\n\\nYou can use the Flow parser in your browser or in node. To use in node you can just do\\n\\n```JavaScript\\nrequire(\'flow-parser\').parse(\'1+1\', {});\\n```\\n\\nTo use in the browser, you can add\\n\\n```HTML\\n<script src=\\"flow_parser.js\\"><\/script>\\n```\\n\\nwhich will make the `flow` object available to use like so:\\n\\n```JavaScript\\nflow.parse(\'1+1\', {});\\n```\\n\\n## Options\\n\\nThe second argument to `flow.parse` is the options object. Currently supported options:\\n\\n* `all_comments` (boolean, default `true`) - include a list of all comments from the whole program\\n* `comments` (boolean, default `true`) - attach comments to AST nodes (`leadingComments` and `trailingComments`)\\n* `enums` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of Flow enums\\n* `esproposal_decorators` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of decorators\\n* `esproposal_export_star_as` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of `export * as` syntax\\n* `tokens` (boolean, default `false`) - include a list of all parsed tokens in a top-level `tokens` property\\n* `types` (boolean, default `true`) - enable parsing of Flow types\\n* `use_strict` (boolean, default `false`) - treat the file as strict, without needing a \\"use strict\\" directive","licenseModified":"no","path":"/Users//Development/Portfolio/node_modules/flow-parser"},"follow-redirects@1.15.6":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/follow-redirects/follow-redirects","publisher":"Ruben Verborgh","email":"ruben@verborgh.org","url":"https://ruben.verborgh.org/","name":"follow-redirects","version":"1.15.6","description":"HTTP and HTTPS modules that follow redirects.","copyright":"Copyright 2014\u2013present Olivier Lalonde <olalonde@gmail.com>, James Talmage <james@talmage.io>, Ruben Verborgh","licenseFile":"/Users//Development/Portfolio/node_modules/follow-redirects/LICENSE","licenseText":"Copyright 2014\u2013present Olivier Lalonde <olalonde@gmail.com>, James Talmage <james@talmage.io>, Ruben Verborgh\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \\"Software\\"), to deal in\\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\\nso, subject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\"AS IS\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This shim is primarily useful if you want ES6 `Reflect`\\nsupport on older browsers or versions of node.js < v6.0.0, or if you want\\nES6 `Proxy` support on versions of node.js < v6.0.0.\\n\\n**May 2016 update**: the recently released [V8 v4.9](http://v8project.blogspot.com.au/2016/01/v8-release-49.html) includes native support for ES2015 Proxies and Reflect, making this library obsolete for environments that embed V8 4.9 or newer (like Chrome 49 and Node v6.0). Node v5.10.x or lower still requires this polyfill for proper ES6 Proxy support.\\n\\nRead [Why should I use this library?](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/wiki)\\n\\nInstallation\\n============\\n\\nFor node.js, install via [npm](http://npmjs.org):\\n\\n    npm install harmony-reflect\\n\\nThen:\\n\\n    node --harmony-proxies\\n    > var Reflect = require(\'harmony-reflect\');\\n\\nSee [release notes](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/blob/master/RELNOTES.md) for changes to the npm releases.\\n\\nTo use in a browser, just download the single reflect.js file. After loading\\n\\n    <script src=\\"reflect.js\\"><\/script>\\n\\na global object `Reflect` is defined that contains reflection methods as defined in the [ES6 spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-reflect-object).\\n\\nThis library also updates the \\"harmony-era\\" `Proxy` object in the V8 engine\\n(also used in node.js) to follow the latest [ECMAScript 2015](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) spec.\\nTo create such a proxy, call:\\n\\n    var proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);\\n\\nSee below for a list of spec incompatibilities and other gotcha\'s.\\n\\nAPI Docs\\n========\\n\\nThis module exports an object named `Reflect` and updates the global `Proxy` object (if it exists) to be compatible with the latest ECMAScript 6 spec.\\n\\nThe ECMAScript 6 Proxy API allows one to intercept various operations on Javascript objects.\\n\\n  * Overview of all [supported traps](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/tree/master/doc/traps.md) on proxies\\n  * The [Reflect API](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/tree/master/doc/api.md) \\n  * The Proxy [Handler API](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/tree/master/doc/handler_api.md)\\n  \\nCompatibility\\n=============\\n\\nThe `Reflect` API, with support for proxies, was tested on:\\n\\n  * Firefox (>= v4.0)\\n  * `node --harmony_proxies` (>= v0.7.8)\\n  * `iojs --harmony_proxies` (>= 2.3.0)\\n  * `v8 --harmony_proxies` (>= v3.6)\\n  * Any recent `js` spidermonkey shell\\n\\nIf you need only `Reflect` and not an up-to-date `Proxy` object, this\\nlibrary should work on any modern ES5 engine (including all browsers).\\n\\nCompatibility notes:\\n\\n  * Chrome (>= v19 && <= v37) used to support proxies behind a flag\\n    (`chrome://flags/#enable-javascript-harmony`) but Chrome v38  [removed](https://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=1543#c44) the `Proxy` constructor. As a result, this library cannot patch the harmony-era `Proxy` object on Chrome v38 or above. If you\'re working with Chromium directly, it\'s still possible to enable proxies using `chromium-browser --js-flags=\\"--harmony_proxies\\"`.\\n  * In older versions of V8, the `Proxy` constructor was enabled by\\n    default when starting V8 with `--harmony`. For recent versions of V8,\\n    `Proxy` must be explicitly enabled with `--harmony_proxies`.\\n\\nDependencies\\n============\\n\\n  *  ECMAScript 5/strict\\n  *  To emulate direct proxies:\\n    *  old Harmony [Proxies](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:proxies)\\n    *  Harmony [WeakMaps](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:weak_maps)\\n\\nAfter loading `reflect.js` into your page or other JS environment, be aware that the following globals are patched to be able to recognize emulated direct proxies:\\n\\n    Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor\\n    Object.defineProperty\\n    Object.defineProperties\\n    Object.getOwnPropertyNames\\n    Object.getOwnPropertySymbols\\n    Object.keys\\n    Object.{get,set}PrototypeOf\\n    Object.assign\\n    Object.{freeze,seal,preventExtensions}\\n    Object.{isFrozen,isSealed,isExtensible}\\n    Object.prototype.valueOf\\n    Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf\\n    Object.prototype.toString\\n    Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty\\n    Function.prototype.toString\\n    Date.prototype.toString\\n    Array.isArray\\n    Array.prototype.concat\\n    Proxy\\n    Reflect\\n\\n:warning: In node.js, when you `require(\'harmony-reflect\')`, only the current\\nmodule\'s globals are patched. If you pass an emulated direct proxy to an external module, and that module uses the unpatched globals, the module may not interact with the proxy according to the latest ES6 Proxy API, instead falling\\nback on the old pre-ES6 Proxy API. This can cause bugs, e.g. the built-in `Array.isArray` will return `false` when passed a proxy-for-array, while the\\npatched `Array.isArray` will return true. I know of no good fix to reliably patch the globals for all node modules. If you do, let me know.\\n\\nExamples\\n========\\n\\nThe [examples](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/tree/master/examples) directory contains a number of examples demonstrating the use of proxies:\\n\\n  * membranes: wrappers that transitively isolate two object-graphs.\\n  * observer: a self-hosted implementation of the ES7 `Object.observe` notification mechanism.\\n  * profiler: a simple profiler to collect usage statistics of an object.\\n\\nOther example uses of proxies (not done by me, but using this library):\\n\\n  * supporting [negative array indices](https://github.com/sindresorhus/negative-array) a la Python\\n  * [tpyo](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/tpyo): using proxies to correct typo\'s in JS property names\\n  * [persistent objects](http://tagtree.tv/es6-proxies): shows how one might go about using proxies to save updates to objects in a database incrementally\\n  * [defaultdict](https://github.com/greenify/defaultdict2): default values for new keys in objects (as known from Python)\\n\\nFor more examples of proxies, and a good overview of their design rationale, I recommend reading [Axel Rauschmayer\'s blog post on proxies](http://www.2ality.com/2014/12/es6-proxies.html).\\n\\nProxy Handler API\\n=================\\n\\nThe sister project [proxy-handlers](https://github.com/tvcutsem/proxy-handlers)\\ndefines a number of predefined Proxy handlers as \\"abstract classes\\" that your \\ncode can \\"subclass\\" The goal is to minimize the number of traps that your proxy\\nhandlers must implement.\\n\\nSpec Incompatibilities and other gotcha\'s\\n=========================================\\n\\nThis library differs from the [ECMAScript 2016 spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html) as follows:\\n\\n  * In ES7, the `enumerate()` trap, and the corresponding `Reflect.enumerate()` method, have been [removed](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/issues/161).\\n    This shim still supports the trap.\\n  * The ES7 (and ES6) spec contains a \\n    [bug](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/666) that leads to missing\\n    invariant checks in the getOwnPropertyDescriptor, defineProperty and deleteProperty traps. This library already contains the patch referred\\n    to in [this issue](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/666).\\n\\nThis library differs from the [ECMAScript 2015 spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) as follows:\\n\\n  * In ES6, `Proxy` is a constructor function that _requires_ the use\\n    of `new`. That is, you must write `new Proxy(target, handler)`. This library\\n    exports `Proxy` as an ordinary function which may be called with or without using the `new` operator.\\n    \\n  * In ES6, `Function.prototype.toString` and `Date.prototype.toString` do not\\n    operate transparently on Proxies. This shim patches those functions so that\\n    stringifying a Proxy-for-a-function or a Proxy-for-a-date \\"unwraps\\" the\\n    proxy and instead stringifies the target of the Proxy. This behavior may\\n    change in the future to be more spec-compatible.\\n    \\n  * This library does not shim [Symbol objects](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-symbol-objects).\\n    On modern V8 or io.js which supports Symbol objects natively, due to a bug in V8, Symbols and Proxies\\n    don\'t play well together. [Read more](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/issues/57).\\n  \\n  * Proxies-for-arrays are serialized as JSON objects rather than as JSON arrays. That is, `JSON.stringify(new Proxy([], {}))` returns \\"{}\\" rather than \\"[]\\".

Which is OK for _this_ particular application. You can write a super light/fast parser in JS with regex.\\n\\n\\"Why on earth would you do this?! Haven\'t you read: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags ?!?!\\"\\n\\nWhy yes, yes I have :)\\n\\nBut the truth is. If you _could_ do this in a whopping grand total of ~600 bytes (min+gzip) as this repo shows. It potentially enables DOM diffing based on a HTML strings to be super light and fast in a browser. What is that you say? DOM-diffing?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nReact.js essentially pioneered the approach. With React you render to a \\"virtual DOM\\" whenever you want to, and the virtual DOM can then diff against the real DOM (or the last virtual DOM) and then turn that diff into whatever transformations are necessary to get the _real_ DOM to match what you rendered as efficiently as possible.\\n\\nAs a result, when you\'re building a single page app, you don\'t have to worry so much about bindings. Instead, you simple re-render to the virtual DOM whenever you know something\'s changed. All of a sudden being able to have `change` events for individual properties becomes less important, instead you can just reference those values in your template whenever you think something changed.\\n\\nCool idea, right?!\\n\\n## So why this?\\n\\nWell, there are other things React expects me to do if I use it that I don\'t like. Such as the custom templating and syntax you have to use.\\n\\nIf, hypothetically, you could instead diff an HTML string (generated by _whatever_ templating language of your choice) against the DOM, then you\'d get the same benefit, sans React\'s impositions.\\n\\nThis may all turn out to be a bad idea altogether, but initial results seem promising when paired with [virtual-dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom).\\n\\nBut you can\'t just diff HTML strings, as simple strings, very easily, in order to diff two HTML node trees you have to first turn that string into a tree structure of some sort. Typically, the thing you generate from parsing something like this is called an AST (abstract syntax tree).\\n\\nThis lib does exactly that.\\n\\nIt has two methods:\\n\\n1. parse\\n2. stringify\\n\\n## `.parse(htmlString, options)`\\n\\nTakes a string of HTML and turns it into an AST, the only option you can currently pass is an object of registered `components` whose children will be ignored when generating the AST.\\n\\n## `.stringify(AST)`\\n\\nTakes an AST and turns it back into a string of HTML.\\n\\n## What does the AST look like?\\n\\nSee comments in the following example:\\n\\n```js\\nvar HTML = require(\'html-parse-stringify\')\\n\\n// this html:\\nvar html = \'<div class=\\"oh\\"><p>hi</p></div>\'\\n\\n// becomes this AST:\\nvar ast = HTML.parse(html)\\n\\nconsole.log(ast)\\n/*\\n{\\n    // can be `tag`, `text` or `component`\\n    type: \'tag\',\\n\\n    // name of tag if relevant\\n    name: \'div\',\\n    \\n    // parsed attribute object\\n    attrs: {\\n        class: \'oh\'\\n    },\\n\\n    // whether this is a self-closing tag\\n    // such as <img/>\\n    voidElement: false,\\n\\n    // an array of child nodes\\n    // we see the same structure\\n    // repeated in each of these\\n    children: [\\n        {\\n            type: \'tag\',\\n            name: \'p\',\\n            attrs: {},\\n            voidElement: false,\\n            children: [\\n                // this is a text node\\n                // it also has a `type`\\n                // but nothing other than\\n                // a `content` containing\\n                // its text.\\n                {\\n                    type: \'text\',\\n                    content: \'hi\'\\n                }\\n            ]\\n        }\\n    ]\\n}\\n*/\\n```\\n\\n## the AST node types\\n\\n### 1. tag\\n\\nproperties:\\n\\n- `type` - will always be `tag` for this type of node\\n- `name` - tag name, such as \'div\'\\n- `attrs` - an object of key/value pairs. If an attribute has multiple space-separated items such as classes, they\'ll still be in a single string, for example: `class: \\"class1 class2\\"`\\n- `voidElement` - `true` or `false`. Whether this tag is a known void element as defined by [spec](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/syntax.html#void-elements).\\n- `children` - array of child nodes. Note that any continuous string of text is a text node child, see below.\\n\\n### 2. text\\n\\nproperties:\\n\\n- `type` - will always be `text` for this type of node\\n- `content` - text content of the node\\n\\n### 3. component\\n\\nIf you pass an object of `components` as part of the `options` object passed as the second argument to `.parse()` then the AST won\'t keep parsing that branch of the DOM tree when it one of those registered components.\\n\\nThis is so that it\'s possible to ignore sections of the tree that you may want to handle by another \\"subview\\" in your application that handles it\'s own DOM diffing.\\n\\nproperties:\\n\\n- `type` - will always be `component` for this type of node\\n- `name` - tag name, such as \'div\'\\n- `attrs` - an object of key/value pairs. If an attribute has multiple space-separated items such as classes, they\'ll still be in a single string, for example: `class: \\"class1 class2\\"`\\n- `voidElement` - `true` or `false`. Whether this tag is a known void element as defined by [spec](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/syntax.html#void-elements).\\n- `children` - it will still have a `children` array, but it will always be empty.\\n\\n## changelog\\n\\n- `3.0.1` Merged #47 which makes void elements check case insensitive. Thanks again, [@adrai](https://github.com/adrai) for this contribution!\\n- `3.0.0` Merged #46 which fixed an issue with handling of whitespace. Doing major version bump since this changes behavior if you have whitespace only nodes (see merged PR and #45 for more details). Thanks [@adrai](https://github.com/adrai) for this contribution!\\n- `2.1.1` Merged #41 which fixed an issue with tag nesting. Thanks [@ericponto](https://github.com/ericponto).\\n- `2.1.0` Merged support for numeric tags. This allows a use case described in [this PR](https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/html-parse-stringify/pull/43). Thanks [@kachkaev](https://github.com/kachkaev).\\n- `2.0.3` Fixed failed publish. Accidentally published an empty package :sweat_smile:\\n- `2.0.2` Fixed incorrect attribution for vulnerability disclosure. The vulnerability was discovered by Yeting Li. Sam Sanoop was the one who reached out to me about it.\\n- `2.0.1` Addressing a reported regular expression denial of service issue found by [Yeting Li](https://github.com/yetingli) and reported to me by [Sam Sanoop](https://twitter.com/snoopysecurity) of [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) THANK YOU!. The issue was that sending certain input would cause one of the regular expressions we used to lock up and not finish, freezing the process. See the test that was added for details. To be clear, this lib wasn\'t meant for parsing non-well formed HTML. But, better safe than sorry! So we\'re fixing it.\\n- `2.0.0` updated to more modern dependencies/build system. Switched to prettier, etc. No big feature differences, just new build system/project structure. Added support for top level text nodes thanks to @jperl. Added support for comments thanks to @pconerly.\\n- `1.0.0 - 1.0.3` no big changes, bug fixes and speed improvements.\\n\\n## credits\\n\\nIf this sounds interesting you should probably follow [@HenrikJoreteg](https://twitter.com/henrikjoreteg) and [@Philip_Roberts](https://twitter.com/philip_roberts) on twitter to see how this all turns out.\\n\\n## license\\n\\nMIT","licenseModified":"no","path":"/Users//Development/Portfolio/node_modules/html-parse-stringify"},"html-webpack-plugin@5.6.0":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin","publisher":"Jan Nicklas","email":"j.nicklas@me.com","url":"https://github.com/jantimon","name":"html-webpack-plugin","version":"5.6.0","description":"Simplifies creation of HTML files to serve your webpack bundles","copyright":"Copyright JS Foundation and other contributors","licenseFile":"/Users//Development/Portfolio/node_modules/html-webpack-plugin/LICENSE","licenseText":"Copyright JS Foundation and other contributors\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\\n\'Software\'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\\nthe following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \'AS IS\', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.","licenseModified":"no","path":"/Users//Development/Portfolio/node_modules/html-webpack-plugin"},"htmlparser2@6.1.0":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/fb55/htmlparser2","publisher":"Felix Boehm","email":"me@feedic.com","name":"htmlparser2","version":"6.1.0","description":"Fast & forgiving HTML/XML parser","copyright":"Copyright 2010, 2011, Chris Winberry <chris@winberry.net>.

In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.\\n\\nInstallation\\n------------\\n\\nTo use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.\\n\\n```html\\n<script type=\\"text/javascript\\" src=\\"/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js\\"><\/script>\\n<script>\\n// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3\\n<\/script>\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\nTo use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install imurmurhash\\n```\\n\\nThen simply include it in your scripts:\\n\\n```javascript\\nMurmurHash3 = require(\'imurmurhash\');\\n```\\n\\nQuick Example\\n-------------\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Create the initial hash\\nvar hashState = MurmurHash3(\'string\');\\n\\n// Incrementally add text\\nhashState.hash(\'more strings\');\\nhashState.hash(\'even more strings\');\\n\\n// All calls can be chained if desired\\nhashState.hash(\'and\').hash(\'some\').hash(\'more\');\\n\\n// Get a result\\nhashState.result();\\n// returns 0xe4ccfe6b\\n```\\n\\nFunctions\\n---------\\n\\n### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])\\nGet a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same\\n// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)\\nhashState = MurmurHash3();\\n...\\n\\n// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the\\n// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss\\n// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.\\nhashState = new MurmurHash3();\\n```\\n\\nBoth methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)\\nIncrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()\\nGet the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Do the whole string at once\\nMurmurHash3(\'this is a test string\').result();\\n// 0x70529328\\n\\n// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part\\nvar m = MurmurHash3(\'this is a\');\\nm.result();\\n// 0xbfc4f834\\nm.hash(\' test string\').result();\\n// 0x70529328 (same as above)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])\\nReset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\\n\\n---\\n\\nLicense (MIT)\\n-------------\\nCopyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \\"Software\\"), to deal in\\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\\nsubject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\"AS IS\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,\\r\\nroyalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the\\r\\nfollowing:\\r\\n\\r\\na) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;\\r\\n\\r\\nb) to prepare derivative works (\\"Derivative Works\\") based upon the Original\\r\\nWork;\\r\\n\\r\\nc) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the\\r\\npublic;\\r\\n\\r\\nd) to perform the Original Work publicly; and\\r\\n\\r\\ne) to display the Original Work publicly.\\r\\n\\r\\n2) Grant of Patent License.

The term \\"Source Code\\" means the preferred\\r\\nform of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available\\r\\ndocumentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby\\r\\nagrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original\\r\\nWork along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.\\r\\nLicensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a\\r\\nmachine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository\\r\\nreasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as\\r\\nlong as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing\\r\\nthe address of that information repository in a notice immediately following\\r\\nthe copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.\\r\\n\\r\\n4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names\\r\\nof any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or\\r\\nservice marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this\\r\\nOriginal Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing\\r\\nin this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights,\\r\\npatents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as\\r\\nexpressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or\\r\\noffer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims\\r\\ndefined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if\\r\\nsuch marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be\\r\\ninterpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this\\r\\nLicense any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to\\r\\nlicense.\\r\\n\\r\\n5) This section intentionally omitted.\\r\\n\\r\\n6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative\\r\\nWorks that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the\\r\\nSource Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any\\r\\ndescriptive text identified therein as an \\"Attribution Notice.\\" You must cause\\r\\nthe Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent\\r\\nAttribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have\\r\\nmodified the Original Work.\\r\\n\\r\\n7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that\\r\\nthe copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein\\r\\nby Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms\\r\\nof this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights\\r\\nand patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding\\r\\nsentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an \\"AS IS\\" BASIS\\r\\nand WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,\\r\\nthe warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\\r\\nPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU.\\r\\nThis DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No\\r\\nlicense to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.\\r\\n\\r\\n8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,\\r\\nwhether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the\\r\\nLicensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,\\r\\nor consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License\\r\\nor the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss\\r\\nof goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\\r\\nother commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not\\r\\napply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor\'s\\r\\nnegligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some\\r\\njurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or\\r\\nconsequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\\r\\n\\r\\n9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or\\r\\na Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to\\r\\nobtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing\\r\\nelse but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You)\\r\\ngrants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work\\r\\nor to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt\\r\\nto do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement\\r\\nbetween Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the\\r\\nequivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by\\r\\nexercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate\\r\\nYour acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\n10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically\\r\\nand You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License\\r\\nas of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,\\r\\nagainst Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a\\r\\npatent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging\\r\\npatent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or\\r\\nhardware.\\r\\n\\r\\n11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this\\r\\nLicense may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the\\r\\nLicensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under\\r\\nthe laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The\\r\\napplication of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International\\r\\nSale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the\\r\\nscope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the\\r\\nrequirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 101 et\\r\\nseq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This\\r\\nsection shall survive the termination of this License.\\r\\n\\r\\n12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or\\r\\nseeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to\\r\\nrecover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable\\r\\nattorneys\' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including\\r\\nany appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this\\r\\nLicense.\\r\\n\\r\\n13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning\\r\\nthe subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\\r\\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to\\r\\nmake it enforceable.\\r\\n\\r\\n14) Definition of \\"You\\" in This License. \\"You\\" throughout this License, whether\\r\\nin upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights\\r\\nunder, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal\\r\\nentities, \\"You\\" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is\\r\\nunder common control with you.

You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise\\r\\nrestricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not\\r\\nto interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis license is Copyright (C) 2003-2004 Lawrence E.

It supports TTL based expiry, making it suitable as a cache or a persistent key-value store.\\n\\n## Features\\n\\nThere are a few existing modules similar to Keyv, however Keyv is different because it:\\n\\n- Isn\'t bloated\\n- Has a simple Promise based API\\n- Suitable as a TTL based cache or persistent key-value store\\n- [Easily embeddable](#add-cache-support-to-your-module) inside another module\\n- Works with any storage that implements the [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) API\\n- Handles all JSON types plus `Buffer`\\n- Supports namespaces\\n- Wide range of [**efficient, well tested**](#official-storage-adapters) storage adapters\\n- Connection errors are passed through (db failures won\'t kill your app)\\n- Supports the current active LTS version of Node.js or higher\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nInstall Keyv.\\n\\n```\\nnpm install --save keyv\\n```\\n\\nBy default everything is stored in memory, you can optionally also install a storage adapter.\\n\\n```\\nnpm install --save @keyv/redis\\nnpm install --save @keyv/mongo\\nnpm install --save @keyv/sqlite\\nnpm install --save @keyv/postgres\\nnpm install --save @keyv/mysql\\nnpm install --save @keyv/etcd\\n```\\n\\nCreate a new Keyv instance, passing your connection string if applicable. Keyv will automatically load the correct storage adapter.\\n\\n```js\\nconst Keyv = require(\'keyv\');\\n\\n// One of the following\\nconst keyv = new Keyv();\\nconst keyv = new Keyv(\'redis://user:pass@localhost:6379\');\\nconst keyv = new Keyv(\'mongodb://user:pass@localhost:27017/dbname\');\\nconst keyv = new Keyv(\'sqlite://path/to/database.sqlite\');\\nconst keyv = new Keyv(\'postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname\');\\nconst keyv = new Keyv(\'mysql://user:pass@localhost:3306/dbname\');\\nconst keyv = new Keyv(\'etcd://localhost:2379\');\\n\\n// Handle DB connection errors\\nkeyv.on(\'error\', err => console.log(\'Connection Error\', err));\\n\\nawait keyv.set(\'foo\', \'expires in 1 second\', 1000); // true\\nawait keyv.set(\'foo\', \'never expires\'); // true\\nawait keyv.get(\'foo\'); // \'never expires\'\\nawait keyv.delete(\'foo\'); // true\\nawait keyv.clear(); // undefined\\n```\\n\\n### Namespaces\\n\\nYou can namespace your Keyv instance to avoid key collisions and allow you to clear only a certain namespace while using the same database.\\n\\n```js\\nconst users = new Keyv(\'redis://user:pass@localhost:6379\', { namespace: \'users\' });\\nconst cache = new Keyv(\'redis://user:pass@localhost:6379\', { namespace: \'cache\' });\\n\\nawait users.set(\'foo\', \'users\'); // true\\nawait cache.set(\'foo\', \'cache\'); // true\\nawait users.get(\'foo\'); // \'users\'\\nawait cache.get(\'foo\'); // \'cache\'\\nawait users.clear(); // undefined\\nawait users.get(\'foo\'); // undefined\\nawait cache.get(\'foo\'); // \'cache\'\\n```\\n\\n### Custom Serializers\\n\\nKeyv uses [`json-buffer`](https://github.com/dominictarr/json-buffer) for data serialization to ensure consistency across different backends.\\n\\nYou can optionally provide your own serialization functions to support extra data types or to serialize to something other than JSON.\\n\\n```js\\nconst keyv = new Keyv({ serialize: JSON.stringify, deserialize: JSON.parse });\\n```\\n\\n**Warning:** Using custom serializers means you lose any guarantee of data consistency. You should do extensive testing with your serialisation functions and chosen storage engine.\\n\\n## Official Storage Adapters\\n\\nThe official storage adapters are covered by [over 150 integration tests](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/actions/workflows/tests.yaml) to guarantee consistent behaviour. They are lightweight, efficient wrappers over the DB clients making use of indexes and native TTLs where available.\\n\\nDatabase | Adapter | Native TTL\\n---|---|---\\nRedis | [@keyv/redis](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/redis) | Yes\\nMongoDB | [@keyv/mongo](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/mongo) | Yes \\nSQLite | [@keyv/sqlite](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/sqlite) | No \\nPostgreSQL | [@keyv/postgres](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/postgres) | No \\nMySQL | [@keyv/mysql](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/mysql) | No \\nEtcd | [@keyv/etcd](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/etcd) | Yes\\nMemcache | [@keyv/memcache](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/memcache) | Yes\\n\\n## Third-party Storage Adapters\\n\\nYou can also use third-party storage adapters or build your own. Keyv will wrap these storage adapters in TTL functionality and handle complex types internally.\\n\\n```js\\nconst Keyv = require(\'keyv\');\\nconst myAdapter = require(\'./my-storage-adapter\');\\n\\nconst keyv = new Keyv({ store: myAdapter });\\n```\\n\\nAny store that follows the [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) api will work.\\n\\n```js\\nnew Keyv({ store: new Map() });\\n```\\n\\nFor example, [`quick-lru`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-lru) is a completely unrelated module that implements the Map API.\\n\\n```js\\nconst Keyv = require(\'keyv\');\\nconst QuickLRU = require(\'quick-lru\');\\n\\nconst lru = new QuickLRU({ maxSize: 1000 });\\nconst keyv = new Keyv({ store: lru });\\n```\\n\\nThe following are third-party storage adapters compatible with Keyv:\\n\\n- [quick-lru](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-lru) - Simple \\"Least Recently Used\\" (LRU) cache\\n- [keyv-file](https://github.com/zaaack/keyv-file) - File system storage adapter for Keyv\\n- [keyv-dynamodb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv-dynamodb) - DynamoDB storage adapter for Keyv\\n- [keyv-lru](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv-lru) - LRU storage adapter for Keyv\\n- [keyv-null](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv-null) - Null storage adapter for Keyv\\n- [keyv-firestore ](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop/keyv-firestore) \u2013 Firebase Cloud Firestore adapter for Keyv\\n- [keyv-mssql](https://github.com/pmorgan3/keyv-mssql) - Microsoft Sql Server adapter for Keyv\\n- [keyv-azuretable](https://github.com/howlowck/keyv-azuretable) - Azure Table Storage/API adapter for Keyv\\n- [keyv-arango](https://github.com/TimMikeladze/keyv-arango) - ArangoDB storage adapter for Keyv\\n- [keyv-momento](https://github.com/momentohq/node-keyv-adaptor/) - Momento storage adapter for Keyv\\n\\n## Add Cache Support to your Module\\n\\nKeyv is designed to be easily embedded into other modules to add cache support. The recommended pattern is to expose a `cache` option in your modules options which is passed through to Keyv. Caching will work in memory by default and users have the option to also install a Keyv storage adapter and pass in a connection string, or any other storage that implements the `Map` API.\\n\\nYou should also set a namespace for your module so you can safely call `.clear()` without clearing unrelated app data.\\n\\nInside your module:\\n\\n```js\\nclass AwesomeModule {\\n\\tconstructor(opts) {\\n\\t\\tthis.cache = new Keyv({\\n\\t\\t\\turi: typeof opts.cache === \'string\' && opts.cache,\\n\\t\\t\\tstore: typeof opts.cache !== \'string\' && opts.cache,\\n\\t\\t\\tnamespace: \'awesome-module\'\\n\\t\\t});\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow it can be consumed like this:\\n\\n```js\\nconst AwesomeModule = require(\'awesome-module\');\\n\\n// Caches stuff in memory by default\\nconst awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule();\\n\\n// After npm install --save keyv-redis\\nconst awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule({ cache: \'redis://localhost\' });\\n\\n// Some third-party module that implements the Map API\\nconst awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule({ cache: some3rdPartyStore });\\n```\\n\\n## Compression\\n\\nKeyv supports `gzip` and `brotli` compression. To enable compression, pass the `compress` option to the constructor.\\n\\n```js\\nconst KeyvGzip = require(\'@keyv/compress-gzip\');\\nconst Keyv = require(\'keyv\');\\n\\nconst keyvGzip = new KeyvGzip();\\nconst keyv = new Keyv({ compression: KeyvGzip });\\n```\\n\\nYou can also pass a custom compression function to the `compression` option. Following the pattern of the official compression adapters.\\n\\n### Want to build your own? \\n\\nGreat! Keyv is designed to be easily extended. You can build your own compression adapter by following the pattern of the official compression adapters based on this interface:\\n\\n```typescript\\ninterface CompressionAdapter {\\n\\tasync compress(value: any, options?: any);\\n\\tasync decompress(value: any, options?: any);\\n\\tasync serialize(value: any);\\n\\tasync deserialize(value: any);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn addition to the interface, you can test it with our compression test suite using @keyv/test-suite:\\n\\n```js\\nconst {keyvCompresstionTests} = require(\'@keyv/test-suite\');\\nconst KeyvGzip = require(\'@keyv/compress-gzip\');\\n\\nkeyvCompresstionTests(test, new KeyvGzip());\\n```\\n\\n## API\\n\\n### new Keyv([uri], [options])\\n\\nReturns a new Keyv instance.\\n\\nThe Keyv instance is also an `EventEmitter` that will emit an `\'error\'` event if the storage adapter connection fails.\\n\\n### uri\\n\\nType: `String`<br>\\nDefault: `undefined`\\n\\nThe connection string URI.\\n\\nMerged into the options object as options.uri.\\n\\n### options\\n\\nType: `Object`\\n\\nThe options object is also passed through to the storage adapter. Check your storage adapter docs for any extra options.\\n\\n#### options.namespace\\n\\nType: `String`<br>\\nDefault: `\'keyv\'`\\n\\nNamespace for the current instance.\\n\\n#### options.ttl\\n\\nType: `Number`<br>\\nDefault: `undefined`\\n\\nDefault TTL. Can be overridden by specififying a TTL on `.set()`.\\n\\n#### options.compression\\n\\nType: `@keyv/compress-<compression_package_name>`<br>\\nDefault: `undefined`\\n\\nCompression package to use. See [Compression](#compression) for more details.\\n\\n#### options.serialize\\n\\nType: `Function`<br>\\nDefault: `JSONB.stringify`\\n\\nA custom serialization function.\\n\\n#### options.deserialize\\n\\nType: `Function`<br>\\nDefault: `JSONB.parse`\\n\\nA custom deserialization function.\\n\\n#### options.store\\n\\nType: `Storage adapter instance`<br>\\nDefault: `new Map()`\\n\\nThe storage adapter instance to be used by Keyv.\\n\\n#### options.adapter\\n\\nType: `String`<br>\\nDefault: `undefined`\\n\\nSpecify an adapter to use. e.g `\'redis\'` or `\'mongodb\'`.\\n\\n### Instance\\n\\nKeys must always be strings. Values can be of any type.\\n\\n#### .set(key, value, [ttl])\\n\\nSet a value.\\n\\nBy default keys are persistent. You can set an expiry TTL in milliseconds.\\n\\nReturns a promise which resolves to `true`.\\n\\n#### .get(key, [options])\\n\\nReturns a promise which resolves to the retrieved value.\\n\\n##### options.raw\\n\\nType: `Boolean`<br>\\nDefault: `false`\\n\\nIf set to true the raw DB object Keyv stores internally will be returned instead of just the value.\\n\\nThis contains the TTL timestamp.\\n\\n#### .delete(key)\\n\\nDeletes an entry.\\n\\nReturns a promise which resolves to `true` if the key existed, `false` if not.\\n\\n#### .clear()\\n\\nDelete all entries in the current namespace.\\n\\nReturns a promise which is resolved when the entries have been cleared.\\n\\n#### .iterator()\\n\\nIterate over all entries of the current namespace.\\n\\nReturns a iterable that can be iterated by for-of loops. For example:\\n\\n```js\\n// please note that the \\"await\\" keyword should be used here\\nfor await (const [key, value] of this.keyv.iterator()) {\\n  console.log(key, value);\\n};\\n```\\n\\n# How to Contribute\\n\\nIn this section of the documentation we will cover:\\n\\n1) How to set up this repository locally\\n2) How to get started with running commands\\n3) How to contribute changes using Pull Requests\\n\\n## Dependencies\\n\\nThis package requires the following dependencies to run:\\n\\n1) [Yarn V1](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)\\n3) [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)\\n\\n## Setting up your workspace\\n\\nTo contribute to this repository, start by setting up this project locally:\\n\\n1) Fork this repository into your Git account\\n2) Clone the forked repository to your local directory using `git clone`\\n3) Install any of the above missing dependencies\\n\\n## Launching the project\\n\\nOnce the project is installed locally, you are ready to start up its services:\\n\\n1) Ensure that your Docker service is running.\\n2) From the root directory of your project, run the `yarn` command in the command prompt to install yarn.\\n3) Run the `yarn bootstrap` command to  install any necessary dependencies.\\n4) Run `yarn test:services:start` to start up this project\'s Docker container. The container will launch all services within your workspace.\\n\\n## Available Commands\\n\\nOnce the project is running, you can execute a variety of commands. The root workspace and each subpackage contain a `package.json` file with a  `scripts` field listing all the commands that can be executed from that directory. This project also supports native `yarn`, and `docker` commands.\\n\\nHere, we\'ll cover the primary commands that can be executed from the root directory. Unless otherwise noted, these commands can also be executed from a subpackage. If executed from a subpackage, they will only affect that subpackage, rather than the entire workspace.\\n\\n### `yarn`\\n\\nThe `yarn` command installs yarn in the workspace.\\n\\n### `yarn bootstrap`\\n\\nThe `yarn bootstrap` command installs all dependencies in the workspace.\\n\\n### `yarn test:services:start`\\n\\nThe `yarn test:services:start` command starts up the project\'s Docker container, launching all services in the workspace. This command must be executed from the root directory.\\n\\n### `yarn test:services:stop`\\n\\nThe `yarn test:services:stop` command brings down the project\'s Docker container, halting all services. This command must be executed from the root directory.\\n\\n### `yarn test`\\n\\nThe `yarn test` command runs all tests in the workspace.\\n\\n### `yarn clean`\\n\\nThe `yarn clean` command removes yarn and all dependencies installed by yarn. After executing this command, you must repeat the steps in *Setting up your workspace* to rebuild your workspace.\\n\\n## Contributing Changes\\n\\nNow that you\'ve set up your workspace, you\'re ready to contribute changes to the `keyv` repository.\\n\\n1) Make any changes that you would like to contribute in your local workspace.\\n2) After making these changes, ensure that the project\'s tests still pass by executing the `yarn test` command in the root directory.\\n3) Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.\\n4) Navigate to the original `keyv` repository and go the *Pull Requests* tab.\\n5) Click the *New pull request* button, and open a pull request for the branch in your repository that contains your changes.\\n6) Once your pull request is created, ensure that all checks have passed and that your branch has no conflicts with the base branch. If there are any issues, resolve these changes in your local repository, and then commit and push them to git.\\n7) Similarly, respond to any reviewer comments or requests for changes by making edits to your local repository and pushing them to Git.\\n8) Once the pull request has been reviewed, those with write access to the branch will be able to merge your changes into the `keyv` repository.\\n\\nIf you need more information on the steps to create a pull request, you can find a detailed walkthrough in the [Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\\n\\n## License\\n\\nMIT \xa9 Jared Wray","licenseModified":"no","path":"/Users//Development/Portfolio/node_modules/keyv"},"kind-of@6.0.3":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/jonschlinkert/kind-of","publisher":"Jon Schlinkert","url":"https://github.com/jonschlinkert","name":"kind-of","version":"6.0.3","description":"Get the native type of a value.","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2014-2017, Jon Schlinkert.","licenseFile":"/Users//Development/Portfolio/node_modules/kind-of/LICENSE","licenseText":"The MIT License (MIT)\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2014-2017, Jon Schlinkert.\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \\"Software\\"), to deal\\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\"AS IS\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Returns an array of `Subtag` and `Tag` objects or an empty array if no results were found.\\n\\nNote that `Tag` objects in the results represent \'grandfathered\' or \'redundant\' tags. These are excluded by default. Set the `all` parameter to `true` to include them.\\n\\nSearch is case-insensitive if `description` is a string.\\n\\n### tags.languages(macrolanguage) ###\\n\\nReturns an array of `Subtag` objects representing all the \'language\' type subtags belonging to the given \'macrolanguage\' type subtag.\\n\\nThrows an error if `macrolanguage` is not a macrolanguage.\\n\\n```\\n> tags.languages(\'zh\');\\n[Subtag, Subtag...]\\n> tags.languages(\'en\');\\nError: \'en\' is not a valid macrolanguage.\\n```\\n\\n### tags.language(subtag) ###\\n\\nConvenience method to get a single \'language\' type subtag. Can be used to validate an input value as a language subtag. Returns a `Subtag` object or `null`.\\n\\n```\\n> tags.language(\'en\');\\nSubtag\\n> tags.language(\'us\');\\nnull\\n```\\n\\n### tags.region(subtag) ###\\n\\nAs above, but with \'region\' type subtags.\\n\\n```\\n> tags.region(\'mt\');\\nSubtag\\n> tags.region(\'en\');\\nnull\\n```\\n\\n### tags.type(subtag, type) ###\\n\\nGet a subtag by type. Returns the subtag matching `type` as a `Subtag` object otherwise returns `null`.\\n\\nA `type` consists of one of the following strings: \'language\', \'extlang\', \'script\', \'region\' or \'variant\'. To get a \'grandfathered\' or \'redundant\' type tag use `tags(tag)`.\\n\\n```\\n> tags.type(\'zh\', \'macrolanguage\');\\nSubtag\\n> tags.type(\'zh\', \'script\');\\nnull\\n```\\n\\n### tags.date() ###\\n\\nReturns the file date for the underlying data, as a string.\\n\\n```\\n> tags.date();\\n\'2004-06-28\'\\n```\\n\\n### Subtag ###\\n\\n#### subtag.type() ####\\n\\nGet the subtag type (either \'language\', \'extlang\', \'script\', \'region\' or \'variant\'). See [RFC 5646 section 2.2](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646#section-2.2) for type definitions.\\n\\n#### subtag.descriptions() ####\\n\\nReturns an array of description strings (a subtag may have more than one description).\\n\\n```\\n> tags.language(\'ro\').descriptions();\\n[\'Romanian\', \'Moldavian\', \'Moldovan\']\\n```\\n\\n#### subtag.preferred() ####\\n\\nReturns a preferred subtag as a `Subtag` object if the subtag is deprecated. For example, `ro` is preferred over deprecated `mo`.\\n\\n```\\n> tags.language(\'mo\').preferred();\\nSubtag\\n```\\n\\n#### subtag.script() ####\\n\\nFor subtags of type \'language\' or \'extlang\', returns a `Subtag` object representing the language\'s default script. See [RFC 5646 section 3.1.9](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646#section-3.1.9) for a definition of \'Suppress-Script\'.\\n\\n#### subtag.scope() ####\\n\\nReturns the subtag scope as a string, or `null` if the subtag has no scope.\\n\\nTip: if the subtag represents a macrolanguage, you can use `tags.languages(macrolanguage)` to get a list of all the macrolanguage\'s individual languages.\\n\\n```\\n> tags.language(\'zh\').scope();\\n\'macrolanguage\'\\n> tags.language(\'nah\').scope();\\n\'collection\'\\n```\\n\\n#### subtag.deprecated() ####\\n\\nReturns a date string reflecting the deprecation date if the subtag is deprecated, otherwise returns `null`.\\n\\n```\\n> tags.language(\'ja\').deprecated();\\n\'2008-11-22\'\\n```\\n\\n#### subtag.added() ####\\n\\nReturns a date string reflecting the date the subtag was added to the registry.\\n\\n```\\n> tags.language(\'ja\').added();\\n\'2005-10-16\'\\n```\\n\\n#### subtag.comments() ####\\n\\nReturns an array of comments, if any, otherwise returns an empty array.\\n\\n```\\n> tags.language(\'nmf\').comments();\\n[\'see ntx\']\\n```\\n\\n#### subtag.format() ####\\n\\nReturn the subtag code formatted according to the case conventions defined in [RFC 5646 section 2.1.1](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646#section-2.1.1).\\n\\n- language codes are made lowercase (\'mn\' for Mongolian)\\n- script codes are made lowercase with the initial letter capitalized (\'Cyrl\' for Cyrillic)\\n- country codes are capitalized (\'MN\' for Mongolia)\\n\\n### Tag ###\\n\\n#### tag.preferred() ####\\n\\nIf the tag is listed as \'deprecated\' or \'redundant\' it might have a preferred value. This method returns a `Tag` object if so.\\n\\n```\\n> tags(\'zh-cmn-Hant\').preferred();\\nTag\\n```\\n\\n#### tag.type() ####\\n\\nReturns `grandfathered` if the tag is grandfathered, `redundant` if the tag is redundant, and `tag` if neither. For a definition of grandfathered and redundant tags, see [RFC 5646 section 2.2.8](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646#section-2.2.8).\\n\\n#### tag.subtags() ####\\n\\nReturns an array of subtags making up the tag, as `Subtag` objects.\\n\\n#### tag.language(), tag.region(), tag.script() ####\\n\\nShortcuts for `tag.find(\'language\')`, `tag.find(\'region\')` and `tag.find(\'script\')`.\\n\\n#### tag.find(type) ####\\n\\nFind a subtag of the given type from those making up the tag.\\n\\n#### tag.valid() ####\\n\\nReturns `true` if the tag is valid, `false` otherwise.\\n\\n#### tag.errors() ####\\n\\nReturns an array of `Error` objects if the tag is invalid. The `message` property of each is readable and helpful enough for UI output. The `code` property can be checked against the `Tag.ERR_*` constants. Each error will also have either a `subtag` or `tag` property with the code of the offending tag.\\n\\n#### tag.format() ####\\n\\nFormat a tag according to the case conventions defined in [RFC 5646 section 2.1.1](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646#section-2.1.1).\\n\\n```\\n> tags(\'en-gb\').format();\\n\'en-GB\'\\n```\\n\\n#### tag.deprecated() ####\\n\\nFor grandfathered or redundant tags, returns a date string reflecting the deprecation date if the tag is deprecated.\\n\\n```\\n> tags(\'zh-cmn-Hant\').deprecated();\\n\'2009-07-29\'\\n```\\n\\n#### tag.added() ####\\n\\nFor grandfathered or redundant tags, returns a date string reflecting the date the tag was added to the registry.\\n\\n#### tag.descriptions() ####\\n\\nReturns an array of tag descriptions for grandfathered or redundant tags, otherwise returns an empty array.\\n\\n## Resources ##\\n\\n- [Python version by the Flanders Heritage Agency](https://github.com/OnroerendErfgoed/language-tags)\\n- [Language Subtag Lookup tool by Richard Ishida](http://rishida.net/utils/subtags/)\\n- [W3C Internationalization Checker](http://validator.w3.org/i18n-checker/)\\n- [RFC 5646](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646)\\n\\n## Credits and collaboration ##\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2013, [Matthew Caruana Galizia](http://twitter.com/mcaruanagalizia).\\n\\nThe software part of this project is licensed under an [MIT licence](http://mattcg.mit-license.org/).\\n\\nComments, feedback and suggestions are welcome.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\\nFoundation\'s software and to any other program whose authors commit to\\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\\nyour programs, too.\\n\\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\\n\\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\\n\\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\\nrights.\\n\\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\\n\\n  Also, for each author\'s protection and ours, we want to make certain\\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\\nauthors\' reputations.\\n\\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\\npatent must be licensed for everyone\'s free use or not licensed at all.\\n\\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\\nmodification follow.\\n\\n        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\\n\\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \\"Program\\", below,\\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \\"work based on the Program\\"\\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\\nthe term \\"modification\\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \\"you\\".\\n\\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\\n\\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program\'s\\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\\nalong with the Program.\\n\\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\\n\\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\\n\\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\\n\\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\\n    parties under the terms of this License.\\n\\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\\n\\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\\n\\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\\ncollective works based on the Program.\\n\\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\\nthe scope of this License.\\n\\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\\n\\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\\n\\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\\n\\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\\n\\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\\nitself accompanies the executable.\\n\\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\\n\\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\\nparties remain in full compliance.\\n\\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\\nthe Program or works based on it.\\n\\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\\nrestrictions on the recipients\' exercise of the rights granted herein.\\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\\nthis License.\\n\\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\\n\\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\\ncircumstances.\\n\\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\\nimpose that choice.\\n\\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\\n\\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\\n\\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\\naddress new problems or concerns.\\n\\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \\"any\\nlater version\\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\\nFoundation.\\n\\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\\n\\n          NO WARRANTY\\n\\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \\"AS IS\\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\\n\\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.","licenseModified":"no","path":"/Users//Development/Portfolio/node_modules/node-forge"},"node-int64@0.4.0":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/broofa/node-int64","publisher":"Robert Kieffer","email":"robert@broofa.com","name":"node-int64","version":"0.4.0","description":"Support for representing 64-bit integers in JavaScript","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2014 Robert Kieffer","licenseFile":"/Users//Development/Portfolio/node_modules/node-int64/LICENSE","licenseText":"Copyright (c) 2014 Robert Kieffer\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \\"Software\\"), to deal\\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\"AS IS\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

These owners may contribute\\nto the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further\\nproduction of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or\\ngreater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of\\nothers.\\n\\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of\\nadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\\nWork (the \u201cAffirmer\u201d), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and\\npublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\\n\\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\\n   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\u201cCopyright and\\n   Related Rights\u201d). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\\n   to, the following:\\n   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\\n      and translate a Work;\\n   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\\n   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person\u2019s image or likeness\\n      depicted in a Work;\\n   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\\n      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\\n   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\\n      a Work;\\n   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\\n      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\\n      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\\n      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\\n   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\\n      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\\n      thereof.\\n\\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\\n   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\\n   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer\u2019s Copyright\\n   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\\n   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\\n   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\\n   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \u201cWaiver\u201d). Affirmer\\n   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and\\n   to the detriment of Affirmer\u2019s heirs and successors, fully intending that\\n   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\\n   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\\n   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer\u2019s express\\n   Statement of Purpose.\\n\\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\\n   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\\n   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\\n   Affirmer\u2019s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the\\n   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\\n   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\\n   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer\u2019s Copyright and\\n   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\\n   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \u201cLicense\u201d). The License\\n   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\\n   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\\n   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\\n   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\\n   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\\n   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\\n   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\\n   in either case contrary to Affirmer\u2019s express Statement of Purpose.\\n\\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\\n   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\\n      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\\n   2.

These owners may contribute\\nto the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further\\nproduction of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or\\ngreater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of\\nothers.\\n\\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of\\nadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\\nWork (the \u201cAffirmer\u201d), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and\\npublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\\n\\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\\n   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\u201cCopyright and\\n   Related Rights\u201d). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\\n   to, the following:\\n   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\\n      and translate a Work;\\n   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\\n   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person\u2019s image or likeness\\n      depicted in a Work;\\n   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\\n      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\\n   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\\n      a Work;\\n   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\\n      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\\n      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\\n      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\\n   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\\n      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\\n      thereof.\\n\\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\\n   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\\n   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer\u2019s Copyright\\n   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\\n   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\\n   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\\n   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \u201cWaiver\u201d). Affirmer\\n   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and\\n   to the detriment of Affirmer\u2019s heirs and successors, fully intending that\\n   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\\n   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\\n   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer\u2019s express\\n   Statement of Purpose.\\n\\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\\n   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\\n   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\\n   Affirmer\u2019s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the\\n   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\\n   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\\n   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer\u2019s Copyright and\\n   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\\n   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \u201cLicense\u201d). The License\\n   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\\n   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\\n   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\\n   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\\n   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\\n   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\\n   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\\n   in either case contrary to Affirmer\u2019s express Statement of Purpose.\\n\\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\\n   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\\n      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\\n   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\\n      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or\\n      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,\\n      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or\\n      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or\\n      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest\\n      extent permissible under applicable law.\\n   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\\n      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\\n      limitation any person\u2019s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\\n      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\\n      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\\n   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\\n      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this\\n      CC0 or use of the Work.\\n\\nFor more information, please see\\nhttp://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/.","licenseModified":"no","path":"/Users//Development/Portfolio/node_modules/postcss-nesting"},"postcss-normalize-charset@5.1.0":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/cssnano/cssnano","publisher":"Bogdan Chadkin","email":"trysound@yandex.ru","name":"postcss-normalize-charset","version":"5.1.0","description":"Add necessary or remove extra charset with PostCSS","copyright":"Copyright 2015 Bogdan Chadkin <trysound@yandex.ru>","licenseFile":"/Users//Development/Portfolio/node_modules/postcss-normalize-charset/LICENSE","licenseText":"The MIT License (MIT)\\n\\nCopyright 2015 Bogdan Chadkin <trysound@yandex.ru>\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \\"Software\\"), to deal in\\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\\nsubject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\"AS IS\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Both APIs are described below.\\n\\n# Backend API\\n\\nBackend APIs are embedded in _development_ builds of renderers like [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) in order to connect to the React DevTools UI.\\n\\n### Example\\n\\nIf you are building a non-browser-based React renderer, you can use the backend API like so:\\n\\n```js\\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV !== \'production\') {\\n  const { connectToDevTools } = require(\\"react-devtools-core\\");\\n\\n  // Must be called before packages like react or react-native are imported\\n  connectToDevTools({\\n    ...config\\n  });\\n}\\n```\\n\\n> **NOTE** that this API (`connectToDevTools`) must be (1) run in the same context as React and (2) must be called before React packages are imported (e.g. `react`, `react-dom`, `react-native`).\\n\\n### `connectToDevTools` options\\n| Prop | Default | Description |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| `host` | `\\"localhost\\"` | Socket connection to frontend should use this host. |\\n| `isAppActive` |  | (Optional) function that returns true/false, telling DevTools when it\'s ready to connect to React. |\\n| `port` | `8097` | Socket connection to frontend should use this port. |\\n| `resolveRNStyle` |  | (Optional) function that accepts a key (number) and returns a style (object); used by React Native. |\\n| `retryConnectionDelay` | `200` | Delay (ms) to wait between retrying a failed Websocket connection |\\n| `useHttps` | `false` | Socket connection to frontend should use secure protocol (wss). |\\n| `websocket` |  | Custom `WebSocket` connection to frontend; overrides `host` and `port` settings. |\\n\\n# Frontend API\\n\\nFrontend APIs can be used to render the DevTools UI into a DOM node. One example of this is [`react-devtools`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools) which wraps DevTools in an Electron app.\\n\\n### Example\\n```js\\nimport DevtoolsUI from \\"react-devtools-core/standalone\\";\\n\\n// See the full list of API methods in documentation below.\\nconst { setContentDOMNode, startServer } = DevtoolsUI;\\n\\n// Render DevTools UI into a DOM element.\\nsetContentDOMNode(document.getElementById(\\"container\\"));\\n\\n// Start socket server used to communicate between backend and frontend.\\nstartServer(\\n  // Port defaults to 8097\\n  1234,\\n\\n  // Host defaults to \\"localhost\\"\\n  \\"example.devserver.com\\",\\n\\n  // Optional config for secure socket (WSS).\\n  {\\n    key: fs.readFileSync(\'test/fixtures/keys/agent2-key.pem\'),\\n    cert: fs.readFileSync(\'test/fixtures/keys/agent2-cert.pem\')\\n  }\\n);\\n```\\n\\n### Exported methods\\nThe `default` export is an object defining the methods described below.\\n\\nThese methods support chaining for convenience. For example:\\n```js\\nconst DevtoolsUI = require(\\"react-devtools-core/standalone\\");\\nDevtoolsUI.setContentDOMNode(element).startServer();\\n```\\n\\n#### `connectToSocket(socket: WebSocket)`\\n> This is an advanced config function that is typically not used.\\n\\nCustom `WebSocket` connection to use for communication between DevTools frontend and backend. Calling this method automatically initializes the DevTools UI (similar to calling `startServer()`).\\n\\n#### `openProfiler()`\\nAutomatically select the \\"Profiler\\" tab in the DevTools UI.\\n\\n#### `setContentDOMNode(element: HTMLElement)`\\nSet the DOM element DevTools UI should be rendered into on initialization.\\n\\n#### `setDisconnectedCallback(callback: Function)`\\n_Optional_ callback to be notified when DevTools `WebSocket` closes (or errors).\\n\\n#### `setProjectRoots(roots: Array<string>)`\\n_Optional_ set of root directories for source files. These roots can be used to open an inspected component\'s source code using an IDE.\\n\\n#### `setStatusListener(callback: Function)`\\n_Optional_ callback to be notified of socket server events (e.g. initialized, errored, connected).\\n\\nThis callback receives two parameters:\\n```js\\nfunction onStatus(\\n  message: string,\\n  status: \'server-connected\' | \'devtools-connected\' | \'error\'\\n): void {\\n  // ...\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### `startServer(port?: number, host?: string, httpsOptions?: Object, loggerOptions?: Object)`\\nStart a socket server (used to communicate between backend and frontend) and renders the DevTools UI.\\n\\nThis method accepts the following parameters:\\n| Name | Default | Description |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| `port` | `8097` | Socket connection to backend should use this port. |\\n| `host` | `\\"localhost\\"` | Socket connection to backend should use this host. |\\n| `httpsOptions` | | _Optional_ object defining `key` and `cert` strings. |\\n| `loggerOptions` | | _Optional_ object defining a `surface` string (to be included with DevTools logging events). |\\n\\n# Development\\n\\nWatch for changes made to the backend entry point and rebuild:\\n```sh\\nyarn start:backend\\n```\\n\\nWatch for changes made to the standalone UI entry point and rebuild:\\n```sh\\nyarn start:standalone\\n```\\n\\nRun the standalone UI using `yarn start` in the [`react-devtools`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools).","licenseModified":"no","path":"/Users//Development/Portfolio/node_modules/react-devtools-core"},"react-dom@18.2.0":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/facebook/react","name":"react-dom","version":"18.2.0","description":"React package for working with the DOM.","copyright":"Copyright (c) Facebook, Inc. and its affiliates.","licenseFile":"/Users//Development/Portfolio/node_modules/react-dom/LICENSE","licenseText":"MIT License\\n\\nCopyright (c) Facebook, Inc. and its affiliates.\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \\"Software\\"), to deal\\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\"AS IS\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

These owners may contribute\\nto the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further\\nproduction of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or\\ngreater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of\\nothers.\\n\\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of\\nadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\\nWork (the \u201cAffirmer\u201d), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and\\npublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\\n\\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\\n   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\u201cCopyright and\\n   Related Rights\u201d). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\\n   to, the following:\\n   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\\n      and translate a Work;\\n   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\\n   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person\u2019s image or likeness\\n      depicted in a Work;\\n   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\\n      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\\n   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\\n      a Work;\\n   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\\n      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\\n      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\\n      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\\n   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\\n      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\\n      thereof.\\n\\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\\n   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\\n   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer\u2019s Copyright\\n   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\\n   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\\n   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\\n   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \u201cWaiver\u201d). Affirmer\\n   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and\\n   to the detriment of Affirmer\u2019s heirs and successors, fully intending that\\n   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\\n   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\\n   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer\u2019s express\\n   Statement of Purpose.\\n\\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\\n   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\\n   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\\n   Affirmer\u2019s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the\\n   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\\n   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\\n   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer\u2019s Copyright and\\n   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\\n   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \u201cLicense\u201d). The License\\n   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\\n   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\\n   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\\n   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\\n   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\\n   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\\n   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\\n   in either case contrary to Affirmer\u2019s express Statement of Purpose.\\n\\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\\n   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\\n      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\\n   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\\n      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or\\n      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,\\n      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or\\n      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or\\n      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest\\n      extent permissible under applicable law.\\n   3.

All mentions\\nof sax in this project\'s documentation are references to sax 1.2.4.\\n\\nDesigned with [node](http://nodejs.org/) in mind, but should work fine in the\\nbrowser or other CommonJS implementations.\\n\\nSaxes does not support Node versions older than 10.\\n\\n## Notable Differences from Sax.\\n\\n* Saxes aims to be much stricter than sax with regards to XML\\n  well-formedness. Sax, even in its so-called \\"strict mode\\", is not strict. It\\n  silently accepts structures that are not well-formed XML. Projects that need\\n  better compliance with well-formedness constraints cannot use sax as-is.\\n\\n  Consequently, saxes does not support HTML, or pseudo-XML, or bad XML. Saxes\\n  will report well-formedness errors in all these cases but it won\'t try to\\n  extract data from malformed documents like sax does.\\n\\n* Saxes is much much faster than sax, mostly because of a substantial redesign\\n  of the internal parsing logic. The speed improvement is not merely due to\\n  removing features that were supported by sax. That helped a bit, but saxes\\n  adds some expensive checks in its aim for conformance with the XML\\n  specification. Redesigning the parsing logic is what accounts for most of the\\n  performance improvement.\\n\\n* Saxes does not aim to support antiquated platforms. We will not pollute the\\n  source or the default build with support for antiquated platforms. If you want\\n  support for IE 11, you are welcome to produce a PR that adds a *new build*\\n  transpiled to ES5.\\n\\n* Saxes handles errors differently from sax: it provides a default onerror\\n  handler which throws. You can replace it with your own handler if you want. If\\n  your handler does nothing, there is no `resume` method to call.\\n\\n* There\'s no `Stream` API. A revamped API may be introduced later. (It is still\\n  a \\"streaming parser\\" in the general sense that you write a character stream to\\n  it.)\\n\\n* Saxes does not have facilities for limiting the size the data chunks passed to\\n  event handlers. See the FAQ entry for more details.\\n\\n## Conformance\\n\\nSaxes supports:\\n\\n* [XML 1.0 fifth edition](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/)\\n* [XML 1.1 second edition](https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml11-20060816/)\\n* [Namespaces in XML 1.0 (Third Edition)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-xml-names-20091208/).\\n* [Namespaces in XML 1.1 (Second Edition)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml-names11-20060816/).\\n\\n## Limitations\\n\\nThis is a non-validating parser so it only verifies whether the document is\\nwell-formed. We do aim to raise errors for all malformed constructs\\nencountered. However, this parser does not thorougly parse the contents of\\nDTDs. So most malformedness errors caused by errors **in DTDs** cannot be\\nreported.\\n\\n## Regarding `<!DOCTYPE` and `<!ENTITY`\\n\\nThe parser will handle the basic XML entities in text nodes and attribute\\nvalues: `&amp; &lt; &gt; &apos; &quot;`. It\'s possible to define additional\\nentities in XML by putting them in the DTD. This parser doesn\'t do anything with\\nthat. If you want to listen to the `doctype` event, and then fetch the\\ndoctypes, and read the entities and add them to `parser.ENTITIES`, then be my\\nguest.\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nThe source code contains JSDOC comments. Use them. What follows is a brief\\nsummary of what is available. The final authority is the source code.\\n\\n**PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO WHAT IS PUBLIC AND WHAT IS PRIVATE.**\\n\\nThe move to TypeScript makes it so that everything is now formally private,\\nprotected, or public.\\n\\nIf you use anything not public, that\'s at your own peril.\\n\\nIf there\'s a mistake in the documentation, raise an issue. If you just assume,\\nyou may assume incorrectly.\\n\\n## Summary Usage Information\\n\\n### Example\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar saxes = require(\\"./lib/saxes\\"),\\n  parser = new saxes.SaxesParser();\\n\\nparser.on(\\"error\\", function (e) {\\n  // an error happened.\\n});\\nparser.on(\\"text\\", function (t) {\\n  // got some text.  t is the string of text.\\n});\\nparser.on(\\"opentag\\", function (node) {\\n  // opened a tag.  node has \\"name\\" and \\"attributes\\"\\n});\\nparser.on(\\"end\\", function () {\\n  // parser stream is done, and ready to have more stuff written to it.\\n});\\n\\nparser.write(\'<xml>Hello, <who name=\\"world\\">world</who>!</xml>\').close();\\n```\\n\\n### Constructor Arguments\\n\\nSettings supported:\\n\\n* `xmlns` - Boolean. If `true`, then namespaces are supported. Default\\n  is `false`.\\n\\n* `position` - Boolean. If `false`, then don\'t track line/col/position. Unset is\\n  treated as `true`. Default is unset. Currently, setting this to `false` only\\n  results in a cosmetic change: the errors reported do not contain position\\n  information. sax-js would literally turn off the position-computing logic if\\n  this flag was set to false. The notion was that it would optimize\\n  execution. In saxes at least it turns out that continually testing this flag\\n  causes a cost that offsets the benefits of turning off this logic.\\n\\n* `fileName` - String. Set a file name for error reporting. This is useful only\\n  when tracking positions. You may leave it unset.\\n\\n* `fragment` - Boolean. If `true`, parse the XML as an XML fragment. Default is\\n  `false`.\\n\\n* `additionalNamespaces` - A plain object whose key, value pairs define\\n   namespaces known before parsing the XML file. It is not legal to pass\\n   bindings for the namespaces `\\"xml\\"` or `\\"xmlns\\"`.\\n\\n* `defaultXMLVersion` - The default version of the XML specification to use if\\n  the document contains no XML declaration. If the document does contain an XML\\n  declaration, then this setting is ignored. Must be `\\"1.0\\"` or `\\"1.1\\"`. The\\n  default is `\\"1.0\\"`.\\n\\n* `forceXMLVersion` - Boolean. A flag indicating whether to force the XML\\n  version used for parsing to the value of ``defaultXMLVersion``. When this flag\\n  is ``true``, ``defaultXMLVersion`` must be specified. If unspecified, the\\n  default value of this flag is ``false``.\\n\\n  Example: suppose you are parsing a document that has an XML declaration\\n  specifying XML version 1.1.\\n\\n  If you set ``defaultXMLVersion`` to ``\\"1.0\\"`` without setting\\n  ``forceXMLVersion`` then the XML declaration will override the value of\\n  ``defaultXMLVersion`` and the document will be parsed according to XML 1.1.\\n\\n  If you set ``defaultXMLVersion`` to ``\\"1.0\\"`` and set ``forceXMLVersion`` to\\n  ``true``, then the XML declaration will be ignored and the document will be\\n  parsed according to XML 1.0.\\n\\n### Methods\\n\\n`write` - Write bytes onto the stream. You don\'t have to pass the whole document\\nin one `write` call. You can read your source chunk by chunk and call `write`\\nwith each chunk.\\n\\n`close` - Close the stream. Once closed, no more data may be written until it is\\ndone processing the buffer, which is signaled by the `end` event.\\n\\n### Properties\\n\\nThe parser has the following properties:\\n\\n`line`, `column`, `columnIndex`, `position` - Indications of the position in the\\nXML document where the parser currently is looking. The `columnIndex` property\\ncounts columns as if indexing into a JavaScript string, whereas the `column`\\nproperty counts Unicode characters.\\n\\n`closed` - Boolean indicating whether or not the parser can be written to.  If\\nit\'s `true`, then wait for the `ready` event to write again.\\n\\n`opt` - Any options passed into the constructor.\\n\\n`xmlDecl` - The XML declaration for this document. It contains the fields\\n`version`, `encoding` and `standalone`. They are all `undefined` before\\nencountering the XML declaration. If they are undefined after the XML\\ndeclaration, the corresponding value was not set by the declaration. There is no\\nevent associated with the XML declaration. In a well-formed document, the XML\\ndeclaration may be preceded only by an optional BOM. So by the time any event\\ngenerated by the parser happens, the declaration has been processed if present\\nat all. Otherwise, you have a malformed document, and as stated above, you\\ncannot rely on the parser data!\\n\\n### Error Handling\\n\\nThe parser continues to parse even upon encountering errors, and does its best\\nto continue reporting errors. You should heed all errors reported. After an\\nerror, however, saxes may interpret your document incorrectly. For instance\\n``<foo a=bc=\\"d\\"/>`` is invalid XML. Did you mean to have ``<foo a=\\"bc=d\\"/>`` or\\n``<foo a=\\"b\\" c=\\"d\\"/>`` or some other variation?  For the sake of continuing to\\nprovide errors, saxes will continue parsing the document, but the structure it\\nreports may be incorrect. It is only after the errors are fixed in the document\\nthat saxes can provide a reliable interpretation of the document.\\n\\nThat leaves you with two rules of thumb when using saxes:\\n\\n* Pay attention to the errors that saxes report. The default `onerror` handler\\n  throws, so by default, you cannot miss errors.\\n\\n* **ONCE AN ERROR HAS BEEN ENCOUNTERED, STOP RELYING ON THE EVENT HANDLERS OTHER\\n  THAN `onerror`.** As explained above, when saxes runs into a well-formedness\\n  problem, it makes a guess in order to continue reporting more errors. The guess\\n  may be wrong.\\n\\n### Events\\n\\nTo listen to an event, override `on<eventname>`. The list of supported events\\nare also in the exported `EVENTS` array.\\n\\nSee the JSDOC comments in the source code for a description of each supported\\nevent.\\n\\n### Parsing XML Fragments\\n\\nThe XML specification does not define any method by which to parse XML\\nfragments. However, there are usage scenarios in which it is desirable to parse\\nfragments. In order to allow this, saxes provides three initialization options.\\n\\nIf you pass the option `fragment: true` to the parser constructor, the parser\\nwill expect an XML fragment. It essentially starts with a parsing state\\nequivalent to the one it would be in if `parser.write(\\"<foo\\">)` had been called\\nright after initialization. In other words, it expects content which is\\nacceptable inside an element. This also turns off well-formedness checks that\\nare inappropriate when parsing a fragment.\\n\\nThe option `additionalNamespaces` allows you to define additional prefix-to-URI\\nbindings known before parsing starts. You would use this over `resolvePrefix` if\\nyou have at the ready a series of namespaces bindings to use.\\n\\nThe option `resolvePrefix` allows you to pass a function which saxes will use if\\nit is unable to resolve a namespace prefix by itself. You would use this over\\n`additionalNamespaces` in a context where getting a complete list of defined\\nnamespaces is onerous.\\n\\nNote that you can use `additionalNamespaces` and `resolvePrefix` together if you\\nwant. `additionalNamespaces` applies before `resolvePrefix`.\\n\\nThe options `additionalNamespaces` and `resolvePrefix` are really meant to be\\nused for parsing fragments. However, saxes won\'t prevent you from using them\\nwith `fragment: false`. Note that if you do this, your document may parse\\nwithout errors and yet be malformed because the document can refer to namespaces\\nwhich are not defined *in* the document.\\n\\nOf course, `additionalNamespaces` and `resolvePrefix` are used only if `xmlns`\\nis `true`. If you are parsing a fragment that does not use namespaces, there\'s\\nno point in setting these options.\\n\\n### Performance Tips\\n\\n* saxes works faster on files that use newlines (``\\\\u000A``) as end of line\\n  markers than files that use other end of line markers (like ``\\\\r`` or\\n  ``\\\\r\\\\n``). The XML specification requires that conformant applications behave\\n  as if all characters that are to be treated as end of line characters are\\n  converted to ``\\\\u000A`` prior to parsing. The optimal code path for saxes is a\\n  file in which all end of line characters are already ``\\\\u000A``.\\n\\n* Don\'t split Unicode strings you feed to saxes across surrogates. When you\\n  naively split a string in JavaScript, you run the risk of splitting a Unicode\\n  character into two surrogates. e.g.  In the following example ``a`` and ``b``\\n  each contain half of a single Unicode character: ``const a = \\"\\\\u{1F4A9}\\"[0];\\n  const b = \\"\\\\u{1F4A9}\\"[1]`` If you feed such split surrogates to versions of\\n  saxes prior to 4, you\'d get errors. Saxes version 4 and over are able to\\n  detect when a chunk of data ends with a surrogate and carry over the surrogate\\n  to the next chunk. However this operation entails slicing and concatenating\\n  strings. If you can feed your data in a way that does not split surrogates,\\n  you should do it. (Obviously, feeding all the data at once with a single write\\n  is fastest.)\\n\\n* Don\'t set event handlers you don\'t need. Saxes has always aimed to avoid doing\\n  work that will just be tossed away but future improvements hope to do this\\n  more aggressively. One way saxes knows whether or not some data is needed is\\n  by checking whether a handler has been set for a specific event.\\n\\n## FAQ\\n\\nQ. Why has saxes dropped support for limiting the size of data chunks passed to\\nevent handlers?\\n\\nA. With sax you could set ``MAX_BUFFER_LENGTH`` to cause the parser to limit the\\nsize of data chunks passed to event handlers. So if you ran into a span of text\\nabove the limit, multiple ``text`` events with smaller data chunks were fired\\ninstead of a single event with a large chunk.\\n\\nHowever, that functionality had some problematic characteristics. It had an\\narbitrary default value. It was library-wide so all parsers created from a\\nsingle instance of the ``sax`` library shared it. This could potentially cause\\nconflicts among libraries running in the same VM but using sax for different\\npurposes.\\n\\nThese issues could have been easily fixed, but there were larger issues. The\\nbuffer limit arbitrarily applied to some events but not others. It would split\\n``text``, ``cdata`` and ``script`` events. However, if a ``comment``,\\n``doctype``, ``attribute`` or ``processing instruction`` were more than the\\nlimit, the parser would generate an error and you were left picking up the\\npieces.\\n\\nIt was not intuitive to use. You\'d think setting the limit to 1K would prevent\\nchunks bigger than 1K to be passed to event handlers. But that was not the\\ncase. A comment in the source code told you that you might go over the limit if\\nyou passed large chunks to ``write``. So if you want a 1K limit, don\'t pass 64K\\nchunks to ``write``. Fair enough. You know what limit you want so you can\\ncontrol the size of the data you pass to ``write``. So you limit the chunks to\\n``write`` to 1K at a time. Even if you do this, your event handlers may get data\\nchunks that are 2K in size. Suppose on the previous ``write`` the parser has\\njust finished processing an open tag, so it is ready for text. Your ``write``\\npasses 1K of text. You are not above the limit yet, so no event is generated\\nyet. The next ``write`` passes another 1K of text. It so happens that sax checks\\nbuffer limits only once per ``write``, after the chunk of data has been\\nprocessed. Now you\'ve hit the limit and you get a ``text`` event with 2K of\\ndata. So even if you limit your ``write`` calls to the buffer limit you\'ve set,\\nyou may still get events with chunks at twice the buffer size limit you\'ve\\nspecified.\\n\\nWe may consider reinstating an equivalent functionality, provided that it\\naddresses the issues above and does not cause a huge performance drop for\\nuse-case scenarios that don\'t need it.","licenseModified":"no","path":"/Users//Development/Portfolio/node_modules/saxes"},"scheduler@0.23.0":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/facebook/react","name":"scheduler","version":"0.23.0","description":"Cooperative scheduler for the browser environment.","copyright":"Copyright (c) Facebook, Inc. and its affiliates.","licenseFile":"/Users//Development/Portfolio/node_modules/scheduler/LICENSE","licenseText":"MIT License\\n\\nCopyright (c) Facebook, Inc. and its affiliates.\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \\"Software\\"), to deal\\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\"AS IS\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Also, `spdy` is compatible with Express.\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\n### Examples\\n\\nServer:\\n```javascript\\nvar spdy = require(\'spdy\'),\\n    fs = require(\'fs\');\\n\\nvar options = {\\n  // Private key\\n  key: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + \'/keys/spdy-key.pem\'),\\n\\n  // Fullchain file or cert file (prefer the former)\\n  cert: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + \'/keys/spdy-fullchain.pem\'),\\n\\n  // **optional** SPDY-specific options\\n  spdy: {\\n    protocols: [ \'h2\', \'spdy/3.1\', ..., \'http/1.1\' ],\\n    plain: false,\\n\\n    // **optional**\\n    // Parse first incoming X_FORWARDED_FOR frame and put it to the\\n    // headers of every request.\\n    // NOTE: Use with care! This should not be used without some proxy that\\n    // will *always* send X_FORWARDED_FOR\\n    \'x-forwarded-for\': true,\\n\\n    connection: {\\n      windowSize: 1024 * 1024, // Server\'s window size\\n\\n      // **optional** if true - server will send 3.1 frames on 3.0 *plain* spdy\\n      autoSpdy31: false\\n    }\\n  }\\n};\\n\\nvar server = spdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {\\n  res.writeHead(200);\\n  res.end(\'hello world!\');\\n});\\n\\nserver.listen(3000);\\n```\\n\\nClient:\\n```javascript\\nvar spdy = require(\'spdy\');\\nvar https = require(\'https\');\\n\\nvar agent = spdy.createAgent({\\n  host: \'www.google.com\',\\n  port: 443,\\n\\n  // Optional SPDY options\\n  spdy: {\\n    plain: false,\\n    ssl: true,\\n\\n    // **optional** send X_FORWARDED_FOR\\n    \'x-forwarded-for\': \'127.0.0.1\'\\n  }\\n});\\n\\nhttps.get({\\n  host: \'www.google.com\',\\n  agent: agent\\n}, function(response) {\\n  console.log(\'yikes\');\\n  // Here it goes like with any other node.js HTTP request\\n  // ...\\n  // And once we\'re done - we may close TCP connection to server\\n  // NOTE: All non-closed requests will die!\\n  agent.close();\\n}).end();\\n```\\n\\nPlease note that if you use a custom agent, by default all connection-level\\nerrors will result in an uncaught exception. To handle these errors subscribe\\nto the `error` event and re-emit the captured error:\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar agent = spdy.createAgent({\\n  host: \'www.google.com\',\\n  port: 443\\n}).once(\'error\', function (err) {\\n  this.emit(err);\\n});\\n```\\n\\n#### Push streams\\n\\nIt is possible to initiate [PUSH_PROMISE][5] to send content to clients _before_\\nthe client requests it.\\n\\n```javascript\\nspdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {\\n  var stream = res.push(\'/main.js\', {\\n    status: 200, // optional\\n    method: \'GET\', // optional\\n    request: {\\n      accept: \'*/*\'\\n    },\\n    response: {\\n      \'content-type\': \'application/javascript\'\\n    }\\n  });\\n  stream.on(\'error\', function() {\\n  });\\n  stream.end(\'alert(\\"hello from push stream!\\");\');\\n\\n  res.end(\'<script src=\\"/main.js\\"><\/script>\');\\n}).listen(3000);\\n```\\n\\n[PUSH_PROMISE][5] may be sent using the `push()` method on the current response\\nobject.  The signature of the `push()` method is:\\n\\n`.push(\'/some/relative/url\', { request: {...}, response: {...} }, callback)`\\n\\nSecond argument contains headers for both PUSH_PROMISE and emulated response.\\n`callback` will receive two arguments: `err` (if any error is happened) and a\\n[Duplex][4] stream as the second argument.\\n\\nClient usage:\\n```javascript\\nvar agent = spdy.createAgent({ /* ... */ });\\nvar req = http.get({\\n  host: \'www.google.com\',\\n  agent: agent\\n}, function(response) {\\n});\\nreq.on(\'push\', function(stream) {\\n  stream.on(\'error\', function(err) {\\n    // Handle error\\n  });\\n  // Read data from stream\\n});\\n```\\n\\nNOTE: You\'re responsible for the `stream` object once given it in `.push()`\\ncallback or `push` event. Hence ignoring `error` event on it will result in\\nuncaught exception and crash your program.\\n\\n#### Trailing headers\\n\\nServer usage:\\n```javascript\\nfunction (req, res) {\\n  // Send trailing headers to client\\n  res.addTrailers({ header1: \'value1\', header2: \'value2\' });\\n\\n  // On client\'s trailing headers\\n  req.on(\'trailers\', function(headers) {\\n    // ...\\n  });\\n}\\n```\\n\\nClient usage:\\n```javascript\\nvar req = http.request({ agent: spdyAgent, /* ... */ }).function (res) {\\n  // On server\'s trailing headers\\n  res.on(\'trailers\', function(headers) {\\n    // ...\\n  });\\n});\\nreq.write(\'stuff\');\\nreq.addTrailers({ /* ... */ });\\nreq.end();\\n```\\n\\n#### Options\\n\\nAll options supported by [tls][2] work with node-spdy.\\n\\nAdditional options may be passed via `spdy` sub-object:\\n\\n* `plain` - if defined, server will ignore NPN and ALPN data and choose whether\\n  to use spdy or plain http by looking at first data packet.\\n* `ssl` - if `false` and `options.plain` is `true`, `http.Server` will be used\\n  as a `base` class for created server.\\n* `maxChunk` - if set and non-falsy, limits number of bytes sent in one DATA\\n  chunk. Setting it to non-zero value is recommended if you care about\\n  interleaving of outgoing data from multiple different streams.\\n  (defaults to 8192)\\n* `protocols` - list of NPN/ALPN protocols to use (default is:\\n  `[\'h2\',\'spdy/3.1\', \'spdy/3\', \'spdy/2\',\'http/1.1\', \'http/1.0\']`)\\n* `protocol` - use specific protocol if no NPN/ALPN ex In addition,\\n* `maxStreams` - set \\"[maximum concurrent streams][3]\\" protocol option\\n\\n### API\\n\\nAPI is compatible with `http` and `https` module, but you can use another\\nfunction as base class for SPDYServer.\\n\\n```javascript\\nspdy.createServer(\\n  [base class constructor, i.e. https.Server],\\n  { /* keys and options */ }, // <- the only one required argument\\n  [request listener]\\n).listen([port], [host], [callback]);\\n```\\n\\nRequest listener will receive two arguments: `request` and `response`. They\'re\\nboth instances of `http`\'s `IncomingMessage` and `OutgoingMessage`. But three\\ncustom properties are added to both of them: `isSpdy`, `spdyVersion`. `isSpdy`\\nis `true` when the request was processed using HTTP2/SPDY protocols, it is\\n`false` in case of HTTP/1.1 fallback. `spdyVersion` is either of: `2`, `3`,\\n`3.1`, or `4` (for HTTP2).\\n\\n\\n#### Contributors\\n\\n* [Fedor Indutny](https://github.com/indutny)\\n* [Chris Strom](https://github.com/eee-c)\\n* [Fran\xe7ois de Metz](https://github.com/francois2metz)\\n* [Ilya Grigorik](https://github.com/igrigorik)\\n* [Roberto Peon](https://github.com/grmocg)\\n* [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa](https://github.com/tatsuhiro-t)\\n* [Jesse Cravens](https://github.com/jessecravens)\\n\\n#### LICENSE\\n\\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.\\n\\nCopyright Fedor Indutny, 2015.\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\\n\\"Software\\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the\\nfollowing conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\"AS IS\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\\r\\n\\r\\nYou must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\\r\\n\\r\\nYou must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and\\r\\n\\r\\nYou must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the Work includes a \\"NOTICE\\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Trademarks.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\\r\\n\\r\\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\\r\\n\\r\\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS","licenseModified":"no","path":"/Users//Development/Portfolio/node_modules/typescript"},"unbox-primitive@1.0.2":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/ljharb/unbox-primitive","publisher":"Jordan Harband","email":"ljharb@gmail.com","name":"unbox-primitive","version":"1.0.2","description":"Unbox a boxed JS primitive value.","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2019 Jordan Harband","licenseFile":"/Users//Development/Portfolio/node_modules/unbox-primitive/LICENSE","licenseText":"MIT License\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2019 Jordan Harband\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \\"Software\\"), to deal\\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \\"AS IS\\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

If You\\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\\n\\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\\n      meet the following conditions:\\n\\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\\n\\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\\n          stating that You changed the files; and\\n\\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\\n          the Derivative Works; and\\n\\n      (d) If the Work includes a \\"NOTICE\\" text file as part of its\\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\\n          as modifying the License.\\n\\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\\n      the conditions stated in this License.\\n\\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\\n\\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\\n\\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \\"AS IS\\" BASIS,\\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\\n\\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\\n\\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\\n\\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\\n\\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\\n\\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \\"[]\\"\\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
